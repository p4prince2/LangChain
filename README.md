#  LangChain Projects

Welcome to my LangChain project repository!  
This repo showcases practical projects built using [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) — a powerful framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).


## What is LangChain?

LangChain simplifies connecting LLMs (like GPT-4, Llama, HuggingFace models) with external data, APIs, tools, memory, and decision-making logic to build **real-world intelligent AI applications**.



##  Projects Included

| Project Name | Description |
|:------------:|:------------|
| **🔹 Build Your First AI Agent** | Create a basic agent that solves math and general knowledge queries using LangChain tools. |
| **🔹 Document Question Answering** | Build a system that reads PDFs or text files and answers questions intelligently. |
| **🔹 Custom Data Retrieval (RAG)** | Connect LangChain with your own CSV, SQL database, or private documents. |
| **🔹 Memory Enhanced Conversations** | Add memory to your agents for more personalized, ongoing chats. |
| **🔹 LangChain + OpenAI Projects** | Play with GPT-powered agents that reason, search, and act based on prompts. |



## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- LangChain
- OpenAI / HuggingFace LLMs
- FAISS (for vector storage)
- SerpAPI (for search tools)
- Pinecone (optional for vector DB)



##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-projects.git
    cd langchain-projects
    ```

2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set your API keys (OpenAI, SerpAPI) in `.env` or directly in code.

4. Run any project you want!
    ```bash
    python agent_basic.py
    ```

##  Future Plans

- 🔸 Fine-tune custom agents for specialized tasks
- 🔸 Integrate LangChain with frontend apps (Streamlit)
- 🔸 Deploy LangChain apps on cloud servers
- 🔸 Build full-stack AI assistants
